When we download plugins using composer, does it come with it's own database and file?
Answer:
When you download a plugin using Composer, it typically does not come with its own database or files. However, the plugin may require certain database tables or files to be created or configured in order for it to function properly. It is important to check the documentation for the specific plugin you are installing to see if there are any specific requirements or instructions for setting it up.

What database and files does plugin need to work when downloaded using composer???
Answer:
It depends on the specific plugin you are installing. Some plugins may not require any additional databases or files, while others may require specific databases or files to be created or configured in order for them to function properly. It is important to check the documentation for the specific plugin you are installing to see if there are any specific requirements or instructions for setting it up.

It's important to note that, the plugin may require access to the database of the application where it will be installed, it might require specific tables to be created or configured, and/or it might require certain files to be uploaded to the server.

is it possible to download a plugin using wordpress docker container ???
Answer
Yes, it is possible to download a plugin using a WordPress Docker container. WordPress can be run inside a Docker container, and you can use the standard WordPress plugin installation process to install plugins.

You would need to have WordPress installed in a container and a web server running. You can then access the WordPress dashboard through the web server and install the plugin from the WordPress repository or upload a plugin from your local machine.

You can use the official WordPress image from the Docker hub and then use the docker exec command to access the container and install the plugin. This can be done by running the command like docker exec -it <container_name> bash, then you can use the wp plugin install <plugin_name> --activate command to install and activate the plugin.

It's important to note that, if your plugin has any specific requirements for its installation, you need to make sure that those requirements are met within the container.

So how can I make a plugin persistent in both dev servers and production servers?
Answer:
To make a plugin persistent across both development and production servers, you can use a package manager such as Composer to manage and install the plugin. This way, the plugin will be included in your project's dependencies and will be installed automatically when you deploy your project to a new environment.

You can add the plugin as a dependency in your project's composer.json file and then run composer install to install the plugin.

You can also use a version control system like Git to track and version your plugin, this way, you can ensure that the same version of the plugin is used across all environments.

Another way to make the plugin persistent is by creating a custom plugin or theme that includes the plugin as a dependency, this way, you can bundle the plugin with your project and ensure that it is always installed and activated when your custom plugin or theme is activated.

You should also make sure that the plugin's settings and data are properly backed up and can be restored in case of any issues. This can be done by using a plugin like BackupBuddy or UpdraftPlus.

It's important to keep the plugin up-to-date in all the environments by monitoring the plugin's version updates, this way, you can make sure that the plugin is secure and compatible with your current WordPress version.

Can I use wordpress docker to make a plugin persistent in both dev servers and p[roduction servers
Answer
Yes, you can use WordPress Docker to make a plugin persistent across both development and production servers. One way to do this is by using a Docker volume to store the plugin files. A volume is a way to store data outside of a container, so that it persists even if the container is deleted or recreated.

You can create a volume for the plugin files by running the command docker volume create <volume_name> and then mount that volume to the WordPress container's plugin directory by using the -v flag in the docker run command, like this:

Copy code
docker run -v <volume_name>:/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins <image_name>
This way, the plugin files will be stored outside the container, so they will persist even if the container is deleted or recreated.

Another way to make a plugin persistent is by using a Docker compose file, in that file you can specify the plugin as a volume, and by doing this, you'll ensure that the plugin is always installed and activated when the container is created.

You can also use a Custom WordPress Image that includes the plugin as a dependency, this way, you can bundle the plugin with the image, and by doing this, you'll ensure that the plugin is always installed and activated when the container is created.

It's important to note that, for this approach to work, you should make sure that the plugin's settings and data are properly backed up and can be restored in case of any issues. This can be done by using a plugin like BackupBuddy or UpdraftPlus or by using a volume for the plugin data.
